# Coding Task

I am doing this task  using Laravel5.3. I named the clients as employees here. I generate the Laravel's auth 
scaffold for the views and using the deafult bootstrap and laravel's style as a stylesheet. 

## Some Extra Packages Used
- For the Client Side Validation
   I am using Jquery Validate Package [http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.validation/1.15.0/jquery.validate.js](http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.validation/1.15.0/jquery.validate.js). 
- For the Pagination of Table
   I am using Jquery Datatable [https://datatables.net/](https://datatables.net/)
- For Icons 
   I am using ionic fonts [http://ionicons.com/](http://ionicons.com/)
   
## How to Run this ?
 - Clone the project to your computer by running the command "git clone https://github.com/madhusudhan1234/coding-task.git"
 - Rename .env.example file into .env and add your loggly token
 - Run commands "npm install" and then "npm install gulp"
 - Go up to your project directory from command line and run the command "php artisan serve" or "php artisan serve --port your-port"
 - Go to your browser and type in the URL "localhost:8000" or "localhost:your-port"
-  Then, hopefully you may be good to go

   
## Official Documentation 

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

##Logging Of the Application

For Logging I used the loggly.com for the cloud based logging. And Laravel's LoggerInterface and monolog library 
i used.
